live session week 2 code along base

News site:
This weeks assignment was about building a responsive website with HTML and CSS.
The focus was on Grid, Flex and responsiveness.

The problem:
I tried to use different approaches whenever a problem occurred. Sometimes just taking a small break and coming back to it with a clear helped a lot. Google was always my first choice of problem solving but I also realized that a lot of my classmates had the same problem that I had. So using slack and stack overflow helped me tremendously.
I started to plan my project by sketching up the design for mobile, desktop and tablet.
If I hade more time I would continue on working on my navbar and header. Another part I would have continued on working on is the news item cards.
